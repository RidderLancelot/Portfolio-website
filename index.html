            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi! I&apos;m <strong>Lancelot Raavig</strong>, a student and aspiring developer currently exploring the exciting worlds of <strong>Biotechnology</strong>, <strong>Mathematics</strong>, and <strong>Physics</strong> at <strong>Egedal Gymnasium</strong>. I have a deep passion for technology and creative problem-solving, and I believe in using knowledge to tackle real-world challenges.</p>
            <p>When I&apos;m not immersed in my studies, I love engaging in meaningful conversations with friends. There&apos;s nothing quite like sharing ideas and laughter! I also enjoy exercising, especially running, which I find to be a great way to clear my mind and recharge my energy. Whether I&apos;m hitting the trails or the pavement, I relish the feeling of freedom that comes with each step.</p>
            <p>In addition to my academic pursuits, I spend my free time reading about scientific developments and advancements in computational mathematics. I&apos;m always eager to learn more and expand my horizons, whether through coding projects or discovering new technologies.</p>
            <p><strong>Fun fact!</strong> My friends are the best friends&ndash; like the Wi-Fi to my laptop, they keep me connected and help me run smoothly!</p>
