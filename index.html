            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi! I&apos;m <strong>Lancelot Raavig</strong>, a student and aspiring developer currently exploring the exciting worlds of <strong>Biotechnology</strong>, <strong>Mathematics</strong>, and <strong>Physics</strong> at <strong>Egedal Gymnasium</strong>. I have a deep passion for technology and creative problem-solving, and I believe in using knowledge to tackle real-world challenges.</p>
            <p>When I&apos;m not immersed in my studies, I love engaging in meaningful conversations with friends. There&apos;s nothing quite like sharing ideas and laughter! I also enjoy exercising, especially running, which I find to be a great way to clear my mind and recharge my energy. Whether I&apos;m hitting the trails or the pavement, I relish the feeling of freedom that comes with each step.</p>
            <p>In addition to my academic pursuits, I spend my free time reading about scientific developments and advancements in computational mathematics. I&apos;m always eager to learn more and expand my horizons, whether through coding projects or discovering new technologies.</p>
            <p><strong>Fun fact!</strong> My friends are the best friends&ndash; like the Wi-Fi to my laptop, they keep me connected and help me run smoothly!</p>

            <h3>Finished Studying</h3>
            <ul>
              <li id="study1"><p><strong>Boesagerskolen</strong> - Folkeskole (2013-2023)</p></li>
              <li class="boesagerskolen study">Boesagerskolen was a typical folkeskole. The school didn&apos;t offer anything advanced, but my math teacher gave me gymnasium-level work in math and science, which helped me build a strong foundation. The most fun part was the projects that combined subjects like physics, geography, biology, and chemistry. Other than that, it was a pretty standard school experience.</li>
            </ul>

          <nav id="currently-studying">
            <h3>Currently Studying</h3>
            <ul>
              <li id="study2"><p><strong>Egedal Gymnasium</strong> - STX: Biotechnology A, Mathematics A, Physics B (2023-2026)</p></li>
              <li class="egedal-gymnasium study">I've always loved science. Initially, I wanted to take Math A, Physics A, and Chemistry B, but when I discovered Biotechnology, which combines my interests in science and technology, I chose that subject instead. Everything has been more challenging and interesting at this higher level. The school gives opportunities to be a part of projects like a microalgae project and a theatre concert, and I've also gotten the chance to participate in ATU, which is exciting.</li>
              <li id="study3"><p><strong>Unge Talenter</strong> - ATU: Extra school for young talented (2024-2026)</p></li>
              <li class="unge-talenter study">I was motivated to join Unge Talenter because it allows me to learn more outside of school. It was even more motivating that one of my best friends, Amira, joined with me. I also remember my first day, where I met Malou, who is just amazing and so sweet. I look forward to exploring new topics and gaining additional skills.</li>
              <li id="study4"><p><strong>Cyber Career</strong> - ATU: Learn about Careers inside Cyber and Cyber in general (2024)</p></li>
              <li class="cyber-career study">I have always loved programming, and since I&apos;m already learning full stack engineering, I thought, why not join the Cyber Career program and earn the certificate? I'm interested in cybersecurity in general. One of my favorite experiences so far has been visiting Aalborg University in Copenhagen and meeting with Norlys.</li>
              <li id="study5"><p><strong>Codecademy</strong> - Full Stack Engineer (2024)</p></li>
              <li class="codecademy study">I have always loved programming, and I thought the Full Stack Engineer program was one of the most interesting and useful courses on the app. I hope to learn how to make both front-end and back-end work so I can get a job in that field in the future, perhaps even for a short period. I believe this program will definitely enhance my skills, and with my motivation and the knowledge gained from programming, I&apos;ll take a significant step toward getting a great job.</li>
